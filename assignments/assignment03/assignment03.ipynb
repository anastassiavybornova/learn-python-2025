    "\n",
    "This assignment consists of six different tasks.\n",
    "All exercises this week can and __must__ be solved purely using pandas. This also means that there is no need for any loops or recursion nor any extra imports.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of each task description, **the actual expected output is provided**. Your task is to figure out how to get a matching result, not necesarrily in looks but in numbers. More nicely formatted prints are very much allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement your solution to each of the exercises in the code field below the exercise description.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Edit and turn in this jupyter notebook file containing your solutions to each task -- keep the same filename.\n",
    "- Make sure that we are able to run the notebook by placing our own copy of `beer.csv` and `wine.csv` inside the same folder as this notebook.\n",

    "# Description of the assignment\n",
    "In this week's assignment, we are going to analyze beer, spirit, and wine consumption of various countries.\n",
    "Data is adapted from a repository created by https://github.com/justmarkham.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, data comes in two files `drinks.csv` and `wines.csv`, and contains information about how much alcohol different countries consume.\n",
    "The format looks something like this:\n",

This is because pandas reads NA as `nan`. To prevent this from happening:* reload the data into a pandas DataFrame, but this time using the optional parameter `na_filter` (check the pd.read_csv documentation for instructions).\n",
    "8. Drop the column `\"total_litres_pure\"`from the DataFrame\n",
    "9. Use boolean indexing to find all the countries that have (a) the same amount of beer and wine servings, AND (b) a higher-than-zero amount of spirit servings.\n",
    "10. Use `.groupby()` and `.max()` to calculate and print out which continent drinks the most beer on average (averaged over all countries for each continent).\n",
    "11. Use `.groupby()`and `.describe()` to print out summary statistics per continent (for beer_servings and spirit_servings).\n",
    "12. Use boolean indexing (or another method of your choice) to print out the name of the country that has the highest number of beer_servings *in the world*.\n",
    "13. Use the method(s)/functions of your choice to print out the name of the country with the most wine_servings *per continent*."
